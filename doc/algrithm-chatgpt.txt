One possible algorithm to group a set of items into subsets for multiple rounds without having items in the same subset again is as follows:

    Define the number of rounds to be conducted and the size of each subset.

    Randomly divide the set of items into subsets of the desired size for the first round.

    For each subsequent round, create new subsets of the desired size by following these steps:

    a. For each item, determine which subsets it has been assigned to in previous rounds.

    b. Identify the subsets that have the fewest items from previous rounds.

    c. Randomly assign each item to one of these subsets that it has not been assigned to before.

    Repeat step 3 for each round until all rounds have been conducted.

Note that this algorithm is not guaranteed to produce an optimal solution, as it relies on randomness to assign items to subsets. However, it should produce reasonably good results in most cases, while avoiding duplicates across rounds.
